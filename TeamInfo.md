## Project Summary

Our project utilizes the YouTube trending dataset, which contains several months of data on daily trending YouTube videos. With this dataset, we aim to uncover patterns and formulas that can increase the likelihood of a YouTube video going viral. To achieve this, we've implemented various sorting and filtering functions, including the ability to search data by date range and sort by view count in ascending or descending order. Additionally, we plan to introduce a creative feature that involves web scraping YouTube video links to find related content and similarities within our dataset. Our goal is to provide users with a powerful tool to explore and analyze YouTube trends, empowering them to draw their own conclusions about what factors influence the YouTube trending algorithm.
