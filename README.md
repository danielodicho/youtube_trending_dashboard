# YouTube Trending Dashboard
This dashboard displays simple YouTube trending video data such as number of views, channel name, and category name. The user can switch from the default view to other views such as the controversial video view to the popular video view. The dashboard offers basic CRUD operations (import, upload, delete, and search). The user can also sort the view by ascending or descending column values. 

## How to Run
Currently, the dashboard is only hosted locally. To run locally, you need to run `python manage.py runserver` in backend/djangoSection and `npm run start` in the frontend directory. The display should look something like this when working properly:
